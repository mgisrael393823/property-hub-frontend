# ZeroVacancy Platform: Claude Code CLI Master Build Doc

## ðŸ§­ Platform Purpose

ZeroVacancy is a two-sided marketplace that connects real estate property managers with verified local content creators (photographers, videographers, drone operators, etc.). It streamlines the entire content production workflow from discovery and booking to delivery and payment â€” with dedicated dashboards for managers, creators, and admin users.

## ðŸ§  Suggestions for Claude Code CLI

- Define `routes.ts` + `api.ts` to centralize route and fetch logic
- Use `mockData` folder as fallback until real DB is connected
- Extract types/interfaces to `types.ts` in each component or central `lib/types`
- Migrate any uncommitted Lovable changes now
- Use `cleanupReact`, `cleanupServer`, and `cleanupCSS` if carried over from Plandex
