# ZeroVacancy Testing Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the testing strategy for the ZeroVacancy frontend application. The goal is to achieve comprehensive test coverage for critical components and functionality to ensure application stability and reliability.

## Testing Priorities

Components and functionality will be tested in the following order of priority:

### 1. Utility Functions and Hooks (High Priority)

- `useAsyncData` hook - Critical for loading data and handling errors
- `useMobile` hook - Used for responsive design
- `useToast` / `useNotificationToast` hooks - User feedback mechanisms
- `utils.ts` - Utility functions used throughout the application

### 2. Form Components (High Priority)

- Form validation with Zod
- Form submission handling
- Error handling and display

### 3. Core UI Components (Medium-High Priority)

- ✅ `CreatorCard` - One of the most important visual components
- ✅ `SearchResults` - Complex component with filtering and conditional rendering
- ✅ `NavigationMenu` - Critical user navigation
- ✅ `EmptyState` - Used for error and empty states across the app
- ✅ `Button` - Primary interaction component
- ✅ `Card` - Layout component used throughout the app
- ✅ `Dialog` - Modal dialog component for user interactions

### 4. Page Components (Medium Priority)

- `CreatorProfile` - Complex page with multiple sections
- `Search` page - Essential user-facing functionality
- Dashboard components
- Authentication flows

### 5. User Flows (Medium-Low Priority)

- Project creation flow
- Creator search and filtering
- Booking process

## Testing Approach

### Unit Tests

For individual components and functions:
- Test input validation and output correctness
- Test different states (loading, error, success)
- Test accessibility compliance
- Test responsive behavior

### Integration Tests

For connected components and user flows:
- Test data passing between components
- Test user interactions across multiple components
- Test navigation flows

### Accessibility Tests

Using jest-axe:
- Test all components for WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
- Focus on keyboard navigation
- Ensure screen reader compatibility

## Test Structure

Each test file should follow this structure:

1. Import necessary testing utilities
2. Define test data (mock props, etc.)
3. Group tests by component/function feature
4. Test rendering
5. Test interactions
6. Test different states
7. Test accessibility

## Example Test Structure

```javascript
import { render, screen, fireEvent } from '../test/test-utils';
import { ComponentToTest } from './ComponentToTest';

describe('ComponentToTest', () => {
  // Test data
  const mockProps = { ... };
  
  // Rendering tests
  it('renders correctly with default props', () => { ... });
  
  // Interaction tests
  it('handles button click correctly', () => { ... });
  
  // State tests
  it('displays loading state when isLoading is true', () => { ... });
  it('displays error state when hasError is true', () => { ... });
  
  // Accessibility tests
  it('passes accessibility tests', async () => { ... });
});
```

## Coverage Goals

- Utility functions and hooks: 90%+
- Core UI components: 80%+
- Page components: 70%+
- Overall: 75%+

## Implementation Plan

1. Set up testing infrastructure ✅
2. Create test utilities for mocking data and providers ✅
3. Implement tests for utility functions and hooks ✅
4. Implement tests for form components and validation ✅
5. Implement tests for core UI components ⏳ (In Progress)
6. Implement tests for page components 
7. Implement tests for user flows
8. Set up coverage reporting and monitoring

## Continuous Integration

All tests will be run as part of the CI/CD pipeline to prevent regressions and ensure that only fully tested code is deployed to production.
