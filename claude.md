# ZeroVacancy Frontend

## Project Overview
ZeroVacancy is a two-sided, real estate-focused creator marketplace built to streamline content production for multifamily and commercial property teams. The platform connects property managers and developers with verified local content creators ‚Äî including photographers, drone operators, video editors, and 3D tour specialists ‚Äî and manages the entire lifecycle from project posting through to payment and final content delivery.

## üîë Core Features
- **Creator Discovery**: Visual-first search experience with filters by service, location, price, and availability.
- **Project Posting**: Managers can post project briefs and receive applications from multiple creators.
- **Direct Booking**: Property teams can book creators directly with a request form.
- **Dashboards**:
  - **Creator Dashboard**: Track bookings, manage portfolio, and set availability.
  - **Manager Dashboard**: Post projects, view applicants, manage payments and deliverables.
  - **Admin Dashboard**: Internal moderation tools for managing disputes, verifying creators, and monitoring platform activity.
- **Notifications**: Visual feedback system (toast alerts + nav bell) for all user actions.
- **Payments (UI-Only)**: Visual scaffolding for a Stripe Connect-style payment system with manager-side tracking and creator-side earnings reports.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Tech Stack
- **Framework**: React + Vite
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui + custom design system
- **Routing**: React Router DOM with explicit route declarations
- **Component Architecture**: Modular, token-driven system with clean separation by UI, cards, forms, layout, and dashboards
- **State Management**: Minimal local state for now (context/hooks), ready for scaling to global store
- **Language**: TypeScript
- **Form Handling**: React Hook Form with Zod validation
- **Data Fetching**: React Query (TanStack Query)
- **Date Handling**: date-fns
- **Charts**: Recharts

## üß± Codebase Goals
- Scalable, maintainable structure using a feature-based folder system
- Fully tokenized design system (typography, spacing, radius, colors)
- All components reusable and centralized (buttons, tags, cards, forms)
- Clean import paths and dead-simple onboarding for new devs

## üöÄ Status
MVP functionality is built and structured, including:
- Creator profiles and portfolios
- Project creation and bidding
- Booking requests and form flows
- Application review workflows
- Payment and earnings visualization
- Admin ops tooling and dashboard structure
Backend integration (auth, real-time, payments) will be introduced in Phase 2.

## Project Structure
- `/src`: Main source code
  - `/app`: Folder structure mimicking Next.js-style routing (logical organization only)
  - `/components`: Reusable UI components
  - `/hooks`: Custom React hooks
  - `/lib`: Utility functions and helpers
  - `/pages`: Page components for different routes
  - `/styles`: Global styles and Tailwind configuration

## Routing Approach
The project uses React Router DOM for all routing functionality, **not** Next.js App Router.
- Folder structure mimics Next.js-style organization (e.g., `/creator/[id]/`, `/projects/[id]/applicants/`)
- All routes are explicitly defined in router config (App.tsx or routes.ts)
- No implicit file-based routing logic is used
- Route parameters like `:id` or `:creatorId` are explicitly defined using React Router DOM's `<Route path="...">` format
- All links and route declarations must match the folder structure but use React Router DOM syntax

## Claude CLI Instructions
When working with Claude CLI on this project:
- Help implement new React components following the shadcn/ui and custom design system
- Assist with TypeScript type definitions and interfaces
- Review and refactor code for best practices
- Suggest optimizations for performance
- Help debug issues with components and styling
- Generate test cases for components and functions
- Help build feature-based folder structures
- Implement responsive design with Tailwind
- Create creator and property manager dashboard interfaces
- Implement booking and project posting workflows
- Develop content discovery and filtering mechanisms
- Build notification and toast alert systems
- Ensure route declarations follow React Router DOM patterns while maintaining the folder structure
- Create consistent routing patterns using React Router hooks (useParams, useNavigate)

## Coding Style Preferences
- Use functional components with hooks
- Prefer destructuring for props
- Use named exports for components
- Organize imports alphabetically
- Use Tailwind's utility classes instead of custom CSS when possible
- Implement proper error boundaries and fallbacks
- Follow a modular, token-driven design system
- Maintain clean separation between UI, cards, forms, layout, and dashboard components
- Use explicit route definition with React Router DOM
