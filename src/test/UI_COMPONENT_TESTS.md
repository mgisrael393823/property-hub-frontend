# UI Component Tests

## Overview
This document provides an overview of the UI component tests implemented in the ZeroVacancy project. These tests ensure that our UI components render correctly, behave as expected with user interactions, and maintain their functionality through future development.

## Components Tested

### Basic UI Components
- **Button**: Tests for all variants (default, outline, ghost, destructive), sizes, and interactions
- **Card**: Tests for Card and its subcomponents (CardHeader, CardTitle, CardDescription, CardContent, CardFooter)
- **NavigationMenu**: Tests for the navigation menu primitive and its accessibility features
- **Dialog**: Tests for open/close functionality, content rendering, and accessibility attributes
- **Sheet**: Tests for side-position variants (left, right, top, bottom), open/close functionality, and custom content
- **EmptyState**: Tests for different states (empty, error, loading-error, no-results) and customization options
- **Tabs**: Tests for tab switching and content display

### Complex UI Components
- **SearchResults**: Tests for:
  - Loading state
  - Error state
  - Empty state (no results)
  - Different view modes (creators vs services)
  - Responsive behavior (mobile vs desktop)
  - Sort functionality
  
- **SearchViewToggle**: Tests for:
  - View state rendering
  - Toggle interactions
  - Proper callbacks when switching views
  - Icon rendering
  
- **SearchFilters**: Tests for:
  - View-specific filters (creators vs services)
  - Mobile/desktop responsive versions
  - Interactive elements (calendar, sliders, checkboxes)
  - Dynamic section rendering
  
- **Navigation**: Tests for:
  - Authentication-based rendering
  - User role-based functionality
  - Mobile/desktop responsive behavior
  - User interactions (navigation, logout)
  
### Page Components
- **Search Page**: Tests for:
  - View switching between creators and services
  - Desktop and mobile layouts
  - Filter drawer functionality on mobile
  
- **CreatorProfile Page**: Tests for:
  - Loading state with skeleton UI
  - Error state with retry functionality
  - Successfully loaded profile data
  - Tabs structure and navigation
  - Pricing information display

### Form Components
- **Form**: Tests for validation, error display, and accessibility
- **Various form implementations**: Tests for complex form UIs like BookingRequest and CreatorOnboarding

## Testing Approaches

### Rendering Tests
- Verify that components render with correct default props
- Verify that children are rendered correctly
- Verify that conditional rendering works as expected

### Interaction Tests
- Verify that clickable elements respond to clicks
- Verify that forms validate input correctly
- Verify that user interactions trigger the correct state changes

### Responsive Design Tests
- Test components in both mobile and desktop viewports
- Verify that responsive variants are shown appropriately

### Accessibility Tests
- Verify that components have correct ARIA attributes
- Verify that interactive elements are keyboard accessible
- Verify that form error messages are properly associated with inputs

## Advanced Testing Techniques

### Mocking
- Mocking hooks for controlled testing environments
- Mocking child components to focus tests on the component under test
- Mocking context providers (auth, theme, etc.)

### Test Environment Setup
- Using custom render functions for components that require context
- Setting up test utilities for common operations
- Managing complex component state during tests

## Next Steps

1. ✅ Implement tests for Dialog component - DONE
2. ✅ Implement tests for Sheet (Modal/Drawer) component - DONE
3. ✅ Implement tests for Search page component - DONE
4. ✅ Implement tests for CreatorProfile page component - DONE
5. Set up coverage reporting to identify gaps
6. Add integration tests for multi-component user flows
7. Set up visual regression testing for component appearance
