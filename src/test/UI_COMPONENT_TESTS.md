# UI Component Tests

## Overview
This document provides an overview of the UI component tests implemented in the ZeroVacancy project. These tests ensure that our UI components render correctly, behave as expected with user interactions, and maintain their functionality through future development.

## Components Tested

### Basic UI Components
- **Button**: Tests for all variants (default, outline, ghost, destructive), sizes, and interactions
- **Card**: Tests for Card and its subcomponents (CardHeader, CardTitle, CardDescription, CardContent, CardFooter)
- **NavigationMenu**: Tests for the navigation menu primitive and its accessibility features
- **EmptyState**: Tests for different states (empty, error, loading-error, no-results) and customization options

### Complex UI Components
- **SearchResults**: Tests for:
  - Loading state
  - Error state
  - Empty state (no results)
  - Different view modes (creators vs services)
  - Responsive behavior (mobile vs desktop)
  - Sort functionality
  
- **Navigation**: Tests for:
  - Authentication-based rendering
  - User role-based functionality
  - Mobile/desktop responsive behavior
  - User interactions (navigation, logout)

### Form Components
- **Form**: Tests for validation, error display, and accessibility
- **Various form implementations**: Tests for complex form UIs like BookingRequest and CreatorOnboarding

## Testing Approaches

### Rendering Tests
- Verify that components render with correct default props
- Verify that children are rendered correctly
- Verify that conditional rendering works as expected

### Interaction Tests
- Verify that clickable elements respond to clicks
- Verify that forms validate input correctly
- Verify that user interactions trigger the correct state changes

### Responsive Design Tests
- Test components in both mobile and desktop viewports
- Verify that responsive variants are shown appropriately

### Accessibility Tests
- Verify that components have correct ARIA attributes
- Verify that interactive elements are keyboard accessible
- Verify that form error messages are properly associated with inputs

## Advanced Testing Techniques

### Mocking
- Mocking hooks for controlled testing environments
- Mocking child components to focus tests on the component under test
- Mocking context providers (auth, theme, etc.)

### Test Environment Setup
- Using custom render functions for components that require context
- Setting up test utilities for common operations
- Managing complex component state during tests

## Next Steps

1. Implement tests for Modal and Dialog components
2. Implement tests for more complex page components
3. Add integration tests for multi-component user flows
4. Add coverage reporting to identify gaps
5. Set up visual regression testing for component appearance
