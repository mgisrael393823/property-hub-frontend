# Form Component Tests

## Overview
This document provides an overview of the form component tests implemented in the ZeroVacancy project. These tests ensure that our forms validate input correctly, display appropriate error messages, and handle user interactions as expected.

## Test Coverage

### Form UI Component Tests
The base form component, built using react-hook-form and shadcn/ui, has been tested to verify:

- Rendering of form elements (fields, labels, descriptions, etc.)
- Form validation with Zod schemas
- Display of error messages when validation fails
- Styling updates based on validation state
- Accessibility attributes for invalid fields

### Schema Validation Tests
Comprehensive tests for the Zod validation schemas ensure:

- Valid data passes validation
- Invalid data fails with appropriate error messages
- Complex validation rules work correctly (e.g., date ranges, password confirmation)
- Custom refinement rules are enforced

### Specific Form Implementation Tests

#### BookingRequest Form
Tests for the booking request form cover:
- Rendering of all form fields
- Validation of required fields
- Error message display
- Form submission state
- Accessibility features

#### CreatorOnboarding Form
Tests for the multi-step onboarding form verify:
- Basic information step validation
- Form field interactions
- Dynamic form arrays (services, equipment)
- Error handling and display

## Best Practices Implemented

1. **Async Testing**: Using `waitFor` to handle asynchronous updates to the DOM
2. **User Interaction**: Simulating realistic user behavior using `userEvent`
3. **Accessibility Testing**: Verifying ARIA attributes and error state announcements
4. **Mock Data**: Testing with realistic form data scenarios
5. **Component Isolation**: Testing form components in isolation to ensure they work independently

## Next Steps

1. Add tests for the remaining form components based on priority:
   - Project creation form
   - Application form
   - Search filters form
   - Authentication forms

2. Add coverage reporting to identify any gaps in form testing

3. Implement integration tests for complete form flows (e.g., submit â†’ success/error states)
