## Page
- Homepage
- Footer
- Creator Cards
- Various UI components

## Issue Description
Our accessibility audit has revealed multiple instances of insufficient color contrast throughout the application. Text elements fail to meet the WCAG 2.1 AA requirement of 4.5:1 contrast ratio for normal text and 3:1 for large text or UI components.

## WCAG Criterion
1.4.3 Contrast (Minimum) (Level AA)

## Priority
P1 (High)

## Steps to Reproduce
1. Run an accessibility check with Pa11y: `npm run a11y:check`
2. Observe multiple contrast errors in the report
3. Verify visually with a color contrast analyzer tool

## Current Behavior
The following elements have insufficient contrast:
- Badge components in CreatorCard (4.39:1 contrast ratio)
- Heading elements in the homepage sections (1:1 contrast ratio in some cases)
- Footer headings with poor contrast
- Multiple UI components with decorative text

## Expected Behavior
All text should meet WCAG AA contrast requirements:
- Normal text: minimum 4.5:1 contrast ratio
- Large text (18pt or 14pt bold): minimum 3:1 contrast ratio
- UI components and graphical objects: minimum 3:1 contrast ratio

## Screenshots
*Include screenshots from the contrast analyzer tool*

## Environment
- Chrome with axe DevTools
- Pa11y accessibility scanner

## Suggested Solution
1. Update the color tokens in the design system
2. Specifically:
   - Increase contrast of badge text or background
   - Darken heading text colors
   - Enhance footer text visibility
3. Consider creating additional high-contrast tokens for text
4. Implement a theme toggle for users who need higher contrast

## Additional Context
This is a major accessibility barrier that affects all users with low vision or color perception issues. Fixing this issue will significantly improve the usability of the application for a large portion of users.
