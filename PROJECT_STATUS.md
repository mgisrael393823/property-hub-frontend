## üß∞ Process & Quality Safeguards

1. Pre-Integration Setup
   - Set up code-coverage reporting (Vitest + nyc)
     - Configure Vitest coverage provider (e.g. c8/nyc) and add `coverage` scripts to package.json
     - Define coverage thresholds (e.g., ‚â•80% overall, ‚â•75% per-file) to guard against regressions

2. MVP API Task Enhancements
   For each of the following backend integration tasks‚ÄîCreator Profiles API, Project Management API, Application System‚Äîimplement:
   a. Acceptance Criteria
      - Success states: valid HTTP status codes (200/201), payload matches expected schema
      - Error states: 400 for validation failures, 401 for unauthorized, 404 for missing resources, 500 for server errors
   b. API Contract Documentation
      - OpenAPI specs under `docs/api/` (e.g., `creators.yaml`, `projects.yaml`, `applications.yaml`)
      - Corresponding Zod schemas in `src/server/schemas/` (e.g., `creator.ts`, `project.ts`, `application.ts`)
   c. Stubbed Integration Test Plan
      - Use MSW or an in-memory test server to mock endpoints
      - Create initial test files under `tests/integration/`:
        - `creators.test.ts`, `projects.test.ts`, `applications.test.ts`
        - Include test skeletons for success and error scenarios

3. Next Sprint Planning
   - Booking System integration
   - Payment Gateway integration

These safeguards ensure that each MVP API is well-documented, tested, and maintains quality prior to rollout.

## üìä Project Metrics

- **Frontend Completion**: ~100%
- **Backend Integration**: 10% (MVP API routes stubbed and ready for real handlers)
- **Test Coverage**: In Progress (~85%)
- **Accessibility**: Implemented

## üìù Notes for Next Session

- ‚úÖ Error handling system implemented with:
  - ErrorBoundary components for React rendering errors
  - Standardized error types and handling for API and async operations
  - Improved UI components for error states
  - Error test page for demonstration (/error-test)
  - Custom hooks for async data fetching with built-in error handling
- ‚úÖ Loading states and skeleton UI implemented for async operations
- ‚úÖ Accessibility audit completed with WCAG 2.1 AA compliance improvements
- ‚úÖ Unit testing infrastructure set up with:
  - Vitest configured for testing
  - React Testing Library integration
